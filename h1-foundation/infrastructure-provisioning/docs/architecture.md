# Architecture — Infrastructure Provisioning

## Design Principles

This template follows the Three Horizons platform standards:

- **Security by default**: Non-root containers, no static secrets, Workload Identity everywhere
- **Observability built-in**: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, distributed tracing
- **GitOps**: All changes through Git — no direct cluster access
- **Policy as Code**: OPA Gatekeeper enforces container security policies at runtime

## Technical Notes

The template follows the repository's Terraform standards: `snake_case` naming, required tags (`environment`, `project`, `owner`, `cost-center`), Workload Identity for auth (no static credentials stored in code), and private endpoints for all PaaS services. The remote state uses an Azure Storage Account created by `scripts/setup-terraform-backend.sh`.

## Platform Integration

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Secrets | Azure Key Vault → External Secrets Operator → Kubernetes Secrets |
| Auth | Azure AD Workload Identity (no service principal passwords) |
| Deployment | ArgoCD GitOps — merge to `main` triggers deploy |
| Monitoring | Prometheus scrapes `/metrics`; Grafana dashboards auto-provisioned |
| Catalog | `catalog-info.yaml` registered in RHDH Developer Hub |
| Docs | TechDocs (`mkdocs.yml` + `docs/`) rendered in Developer Hub Docs tab |
